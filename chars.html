<p><b>Hjolfr of the Reach</b> is a Dunmer of humble birth who, having been adopted by a Nord couple in his infancy due to the death of his birth parents, moved from Windhelm to Markarth in his early childhood. There, while his adoptive father worked as a miner, he met and was mentored by Calcelmo, and befriended Ruki, the Jarl's niece, and Ennis, the kennelmaster's daughter. He spent a happy and active adolescence in the ancient city until his adoptive parents passed away within a year and a half of each other, and he went on a journey to find a place for himself. It was during his travels that he found the Scholars Guild, and he has since then done and seen many things, and put his stamp on a number of accomplishments.
